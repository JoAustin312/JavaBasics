# Simple Java Program
### This is a simple Java program that greets the user based on the given time of day
##### Over the course of this project, we have learned how to:

1. Create methods to execute a specific action, in this case returning a message based on the time of day
2. Have multiple test cases using JUnit to test the functionality of our code
3. Use Git to implement version control with commands such as:
    - Add
    - Commit
    - Push
    - Restore
    - Reset
    - Remote
4. Write readme files using Markdown language
